    "# Seminar for Lecture 13 \"VAE Vocoder\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures, we studied various approaches to creating vocoders. The problem of sound generation is solved by deep generative models. We've discussed autoregressive models that can be reduced to **MAF**. We've considered the reverse analogue of MAF – **IAF**. We've seen how **normalizing flows** can help us directly optimize likelihood without using autoregression. And alse we've considered a vocoder built with the **GAN** paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this seminar we will try to apply another popular generative model: the **variational autoencoder (VAE)**. We will try to build an encoder-decoder architecture with **MAF** as encoder and **IAF** as decoder. We will train this network by maximizing ELBO with a couple of additional losses (in vocoders, you can't do without it yet 🤷‍♂️).\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ In this seminar we call **\"MAF\"** not the generative model discussed on lecture, but network which architecture is like MAF's one and accepting audio as input. So we won't model data distribution with our **\"MAF\"**."

Specifically, the Gaussian WaveNet (if we talk about **real MAF**) models $x_t$ given the previous samples $x_{<t}$ with $x_t ∼ \\mathcal{N}(\\mu(x_{<t}; \\phi), \\sigma(x_{<t}; \\phi))$, where the mean $\\mu(x_{<t}; \\phi)$ and log-scale $\\log \\sigma(x_{<t}; \\phi)$ are predicted by WaveNet, respectively.\n",
